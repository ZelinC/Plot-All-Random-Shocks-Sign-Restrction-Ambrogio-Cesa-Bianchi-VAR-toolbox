# Plot-Sign-Restrction-Ambrogio-Cesa-Bianchi-VAR-toolbox

This file provide an example of how to plot IRFs from all random draw of shocks under sign restriction method using the VAR Toolbox provided by Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi. 

Toolbox can be downloaded from Ambrogio's website https://sites.google.com/site/ambropo/MatlabCodes. On the website, there is one example code for VAR identified with sign restrictions. However the code only provide option for drawing the medians with confidence bands. 

My code uses the IRFs data `INFall` returned from `SR` function to draw the plot. The code is a modification and extension of Ambrogio's sample code `A VAR identified with sign restrictions` (download here: https://sites.google.com/site/ambropo/Example3_SignRestrictions.zip?attredirects=0).
